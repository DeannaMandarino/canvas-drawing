# Canvas Drawing App

An interactive canvas drawing app where users can unleash their creativity by drawing on a full-screen canvas with dynamic stroke colors and adjustable line widths. The app is responsive, and works across both desktop and mobile devices.

## Description

This project implements a drawing application using an HTML `<canvas>`, where users can draw with their mouse or touch. The app features dynamic stroke colors that change based on a hue, and line widths that adjust as users draw. The canvas automatically resizes to fill the entire browser window and is fully responsive, making it accessible for both desktop and mobile users. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
